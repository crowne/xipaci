# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25.3 (backend), Flutter/Dart (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Backend: pgx, Supabase GoTrue, net/http, testify; Frontend: Riverpod, Supabase Flutter SDK, flutter_test, golden_toolkit  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with pgx driver, schema management via Supabase migrations  
**Testing**: Backend: testify, Frontend: flutter_test + golden_toolkit for visual regression  
**Target Platform**: Mobile (iOS/Android) + Web via Flutter, Backend services on cloud infrastructure
**Project Type**: Mobile + API (monorepo with backend-go and frontend-flutter)  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific requirements based on feature scope or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific constraints or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [feature-specific scope or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Repository Structure**: Feature respects monorepo boundaries (backend-go/, frontend-flutter/, shared/, infra/)
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Uses approved stack (Go 1.25.3, Flutter, PostgreSQL/Supabase, pgx, Riverpod)
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Includes TDD approach with testify (backend) and flutter_test (frontend)
- [ ] **Authentication & Database**: Uses Supabase GoTrue and PostgreSQL with pgx driver
- [ ] **Event Architecture**: Uses PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY with JSON payloads and required fields
- [ ] **Versioning**: API endpoints include version in URL path, uses semantic versioning
- [ ] **Identifier Safety**: No auto-incrementing IDs for sensitive entities, uses UUIDs/XIDs
- [ ] **Secret Management**: No secrets in source control, uses environment variables
- [ ] **Observability**: Includes structured logging (zerolog/logger) and OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] **Code Standards**: Uses required linters (golangci-lint, dart analyze) and EditorConfig

```

**Structure Decision**: Xipaci uses a monorepo approach with strict separation between backend-go, frontend-flutter, shared assets, and infrastructure. This structure enforces modularity and enables independent development of backend and frontend components while sharing common schemas and tooling.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
