# Xipaci

Xipaci, pronounced shi-pa-chi, is the Tsonga word for wallet.  
Xipaci provides a wallet which can manage digital tokens.  
The tokens may be retail vouchers, loyalty points, certificates, badges, game artifacts or anything which can be owned.  
The issuer of the tokens specifies the characteristics, such as if they can be transferred, exchanged or traded, or if the tokens have an expiry date.
